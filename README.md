# Async File Logger

Write a program in vanilla JS that reads data from 5 txt files asynchronously and logs the content in console:

```
File 1:  This content is from file 1
File 2:  This content is from file 2
File 3:  This content is from file 3
File 4:  This content is from file 4
File 5:  This content is from file 5
```

## Instructions

1. Array is already given to you in the `script.js` file
2. Just read from the files and console.log the result
